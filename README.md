# Github Practice
This repository's purpose is to help me practice using source
control with github and coding with Typescript using vscode.

## Getting Started

### Installing Typescript
Typescript is exactly like Javascript, except it has strict data types. This can be useful when you are trying to be more exact with your code, but getting started can be a little clunky. I'm using vscode so these instructions are for that, but they may work in other IDE's.

- First, you'll need Node.js installed. You can find that here: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- In the terminal (view -> terminal), run the command: `npm install -g typescript`
- Verify that Typescript installed correctly by running this command: `-tsc`

### Compiling Typescript
Once you have Typescript installed, there are a few handy options you can enable, one being the watch option. Enabling the watch option will automatically compile your typescript for you so you won't have to do it manually, saving time while being hassle free! 

- To accomplish this, run this command: `tsc --watch`
